                    AgriPredict: AI-Driven Crop Yield Forecasting for Sustainable Farming

Overview
Agriculture forms the backbone of the Indian economy, employing over 50% of the workforce and contributing around 18% to the nation's GDP. Yet, the sector faces numerous challenges, from climate change to soil degradation, which can drastically impact crop yield and farmers' livelihoods. AgriPredict leverages the power of machine learning, cloud computing, and modern software engineering to predict crop yields accurately, optimize farming practices, and ensure sustainable agricultural growth.

                                                    Key Features
Crop Yield Prediction: Using historical data, weather patterns, and soil characteristics, our model predicts crop yield and provides actionable insights for farmers.
Real-time Recommendations: The system suggests optimal times for fertilization and other agricultural practices.
Web Interface: A user-friendly web application powered by Flask allows farmers to interact with the model, input data, and receive predictions.

                                             Machine Learning Techniques

1. Data Collection & Cleaning
Collected extensive datasets including weather data, soil type, rainfall records, and historical crop yields.
Cleaned and pre-processed the data to remove inaccuracies and ensure high-quality inputs for the model.
2. Model Training
Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
The Random Forest model was chosen for its superior accuracy and robustness after thorough comparison with other algorithms.
3. Model Deployment
Deployed the trained model using a Flask web application, making it accessible through a user-friendly interface.
Implemented real-time prediction capability using live inputs from users.
4. Results
Achieved significant accuracy in crop yield predictions, enabling better decision-making for farmers.
Visualized the performance of various algorithms to select the most efficient one.

                                                AWS Integration
1. AWS S3:
All datasets are securely stored in AWS S3, ensuring high availability and scalability.
Configured S3 bucket policies to manage access control and data security.
2. AWS Lambda:
Automated data processing tasks using AWS Lambda functions, reducing manual intervention and streamlining operations.
Lambda functions handle data retrieval, model execution, and result storage, making the system highly responsive and scalable.
3. AWS EC2 & ECR:
Deployed the Flask web application on an AWS EC2 instance, providing the necessary computational power to handle multiple user requests simultaneously.
Used AWS ECR to store Docker images of the model, ensuring quick recovery and consistent environment replication in case of any system failures.

                                                Docker Implementation
Dockerfile: The project is containerized using Docker, which simplifies the deployment process and ensures consistency across different environments.
Container Orchestration: Leveraged Docker to orchestrate multiple services, including the Flask application and the backend model, ensuring seamless communication and scaling.
System Design

The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and efficient, with a clear separation of concerns between data handling, model execution, and user interaction.

Front-End: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive interface for farmers to interact with the system.
Back-End: The machine learning model is integrated into the Flask framework, with endpoints exposed for predictions and data management.
Data Flow: Data is collected from the user, processed through the ML model, and the results are displayed on the web interface.

                                                    APPLICATIONS
